Week 6
======


In week 6 we will look at how to create a web application. 

Python has a rich ecosystem of tools for developing server-side web applications. 
We saw last week that we could very easily serve a single web page with the wsgiref package.
This is a useful starting point but for more complicated tasks leaves us with a lot of work to do.

A more popular approach is to use a framework that implements many of the common tasks we are likely to do.

* URI routing
* Sessions
* Database interaction
* Templating
* Error handling
* Security (but still need to be careful)

There are a `large number<https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks/>`_ of very well developed frameworks available.

The two that are perhaps most popular currently are:

* `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
* `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_

We will be focusing on flask as django makes some assumptions that occasionally conflict with scientific data applications.



* Install Flask
* Convert our hello world example from wsgiref to flask
* Convert our hello world example to a template
* Fast introduction to HTML
* Add URI attributes
* Accept inputs
* Storing user supplied data


Assignments
-----------
* Install Flask
* Create a new page in our application
* Accept, store and display a first and last name
